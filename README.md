## New: ROS version and Live demo for Realsense cameras
* **Update May 23, 2023**: The ROS wrapper now supports running DM-VIO directly on rosbags, see [here](https://github.com/lukasvst/dm-vio-ros#new-now-you-can-also-run-in-non-realtime-mode-on-rosbags). This will run in non-realtime mode, but in practice it is usually much faster than real-time.
* **Update Jun 22, 2022**: There is a ROS wrapper for DM-VIO, available at https://github.com/lukasvst/dm-vio-ros
* **Update Jun 15, 2022**: Now there is a live demo for Realsense cameras. See [doc/RealsenseLiveVersion.md](doc/RealsenseLiveVersion.md) for details. The page also contains interesting tips for improving performance on custom datasets.
  * Note that it's not possible anymore to pass IMU noise values with the `camchain.yaml`, you need to use the `settings.yaml` file or commandline args.

### 2. Installation

	git clone https://github.com/lukasvst/dm-vio.git

The following instructions have been tested with Ubuntu 20.04.
The system is also known to work well on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and MacOS Big Sur (only Intel Macs have been tested so far).

#### 2.1 Required Dependencies 

##### Suitesparse, Eigen3, Boost, yaml-cpp (required).
Required, install with

    sudo apt-get install cmake libsuitesparse-dev libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev libyaml-cpp-dev

On MacOS we recommend Homebrew to install the dependencies. It might be necessary
to install boost@1.60 instead of the newest boost, in order for the used GTSAM version to work.


##### GTSAM (required).
Build from source with

    sudo apt install libtbb-dev
    git clone https://github.com/borglab/gtsam.git
    cd gtsam
    git checkout 4.2a6          # newer gtsam versions might not work.
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DGTSAM_POSE3_EXPMAP=ON -DGTSAM_ROT3_EXPMAP=ON -DGTSAM_USE_SYSTEM_EIGEN=ON -DGTSAM_BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=OFF ..
    make -j
    sudo make install

(Note: It seems like the keyframe operations are 2-3% slower with this GTSAM version compared to an older commit. To 
reproduce the realtime paper results you should use commit `a738529af9754c7a085903f90ae8559bbaa82e75` of GTSAM).

##### OpenCV.
Used to read, write and display images.
Install with

	sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev


##### Pangolin.
Like for DSO, this is used for the GUI. You should install v0.6.
Install from [https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin)


	sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev libglew-dev pkg-config libegl1-mesa-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev wayland-protocols
	git clone https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git
	cd Pangolin
	git checkout v0.6
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	cmake --build .
	sudo make install
	
	 

#### 2.2 Recommended Dependencies

##### Librealsense
This is necessary for the live demo for Realsense cameras. See 
[doc/RealsenseLiveVersion.md](doc/RealsenseLiveVersion.md) for details

##### GTest (optional).
For running tests, install with `git submodule update --init`.

##### ziplib (optional).
Used to read datasets with images as .zip.
See [src/dso/README.md](src/dso/README.md) for instructions.

##### sse2neon (required for ARM builds).
After cloning, run `git submodule update --init` to include this. 

#### 2.3 Build

    cd dm-vio
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j

This compiles `dmvio_dataset` to run DM-VIO on datasets (needs both OpenCV and Pangolin installed).
It also compiles the library `libdmvio.a`, which other projects can link to.

#### Trouble-Shooting
The project is based on DSO and only has two additional dependencies with GTSAM and yaml-cpp.
In case of problems with compilation we recommend trying to compile https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso 
first and seeing if it works. 

### 3 Running
Download a TUM-VI sequence (download in the format `Euroc / DSO 512x512`) at https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset

    bin/dmvio_dataset

        start=2                                                         

Instead of typing this long command you can use the [python tools](https://github.com/lukasvst/dm-vio-python-tools).

#### Running on EuRoC, 4Seasons, reproducing paper results, etc.
We **strongly recommend** using the python-dm-vio tools published at: https://github.com/lukasvst/dm-vio-python-tools

They can be used to
* prepare the EuRoC and 4Seasons sequences for usage with DM-VIO.
* run on all (or some) sequences of EuRoC, TUM-VI and 4Seasons and gather the results.
* create a Python evaluation script for inspecting the results and generating the plots shown in the paper.

#### Commandline arguments
There are two types of commandline arguments:
1. Main arguments defined `in util/MainSettings.cpp` (see `parseArgument` and `registerArgs`). Most of these are derived from 
DSO, so you can read [src/dso/README.md](src/dso/README.md) for documentation on them. 
2. Lots of additional settings are defined using the `SettingsUtil`. They can be set either using comandline
or by placing them in the yaml file defined with the commandline argument `settingsFile`.
All of them are printed to commandline when the program starts (and also into the file `usedSettingsdso.txt`).
Most of these are documented in the header file they are defined in 
(see `src/IMU/IMUSettings.h`, `src/IMUInitialization/IMUInitSettings.h`).

### 4 Running the live demo
See [doc/RealsenseLiveVersion.md](doc/RealsenseLiveVersion.md)

### 5 Running on your own datasets
To run on your own dataset you need
* to pass the folder containing files with `files=...`
* an accurate camera calibration! For tips on calibration and the format of camera.txt see 
[src/dso/README.md](src/dso/README.md).
* to set the `mode=1` unless you have a photometric calibration (vignette.png and pcalib.txt).
* a file times.txt which contains **exactly** one timestamp for each image in
  the image folder, or specified through the `tsFile` parameter. Note that this
  file contains the timestamp twice, first in nanoseconds and then in seconds.

When enabling IMU data you also need

* IMU calibration (transformation between camera and IMU) as a `camchain.yaml`. Note that only the field `cam0/T_cam_imu`
and optionally the noise values are read from this file.
* a file containing synchronized IMU data. For each image it **must** contain an IMU 'measurement' with exactly the same timestamp. 
If the sensor does not output this, a fake measurement with this timestamp has to be interpolated in advance.
    The [DM-VIO python tools](https://github.com/lukasvst/dm-vio-python-tools) contain a script to do this (see Notes on IMU-camera synchronization below).
* You should also set the IMU noise values (see `configs/tumvi.yaml`, `configs/euroc.yaml`, and `configs/4seasons.yaml`).
You can read them from an Allan-Variance plot (either computed yourself or taken from datasheet of IMU). 
Note that often times these values are too small in practice and should be inflated by a large factor for optimal results.
We recommend first trying the sample noise values (e.g. the one for TUM-VI) and only using your own if they improve the performance.

**Notes on IMU-camera synchronization:** There are two "levels" of IMU-camera synchronization:
* The first one is that IMU and camera timestamps are recorded with the same device or otherwise made consistent. This is a prerequisite for running DM-VIO.
* The second level is that the IMU is triggered manually and always records an IMU sample exactly during the timestamp (middle of exposure) of each image. E.g. the VI-Sensor used in the EuRoC dataset does this, but most other visual-inertial sensors don't. For these sensors you can still run DM-VIO, but first you need to add a "fake IMU measurement" for each camera timestamp, by interpolating the neighboring IMU samples. You can do this by running

      python3 interpolate_imu_file --input imu.txt --times times.txt --output pass_this_imu_file_to_dmvio.txt

You can first set `useimu=0` to try the visual-only system (basically DSO). If this does not work well for 
comparably slow motions, there is likely a problem with camera calibration which should be addressed first.

**For adjusting your config you might also find the tips [given on this page](doc/RealsenseLiveVersion.md#adjusting-the-config-file) interesting.**
